# Custom Drawing Classifier

This project aims to build a *GUI for custom drawing classifier*, which user can input their own classes and provide examples of classes to predict further custom drawings. Prediction model rotates between `LinearSVC`, `GaussianNB`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`, and, `LogisticRegression`.

It has brush increase & decrease features, as well as rotating between models. Further, models can be saved for further use and loaded.

Python libraries I have used in this project:
`pickle`, `tkinter`, `numpy`, `cv2`, `PIL`, `sklearn`
